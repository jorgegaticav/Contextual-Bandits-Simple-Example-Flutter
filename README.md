# Contextual Bandits Simple Example Flutter

This is a port of Contextual Bandit Simple Example by RealLankinen (https://github.com/RealLankinen/Contextual-Bandits-Simple-Example) to Dart/Flutter.
It is still in development.

## About Libraries Used

I used 2 libraries to access scipy-like methods: 
  - `matrix2d` (https://pub.dev/packages/matrix2d)
  - `scidart` (https://pub.dev/packages/scidart)

I copied some methods from `sample_statistics` (https://pub.dev/packages/sample_statistics), which I preferred not to import since it requires experimental nullsafe features.
For the plotting I used `charts_flutter` (https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter) library
